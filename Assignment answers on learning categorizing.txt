6.Chess-Playing AI
7.Face Recognition in Smartphones
8.Grouping News Articles by Topic
9.Teaching a Robot to Walk
10.Diagnosing Diseases from X-Rays

SOLUTION

1.Email Spam Detection → Supervised Learning (Labeled emails as spam or not spam)

2. Netflix Movie Recommendations → Unsupervised Learning -(Collaborative filtering, clustering user preferences)
 
3. Self-Driving Cars → Reinforcement Learning (Agents learn to drive through rewards and penalties)

4. Fraud Detection in Banking → Supervised Learning (Labeled transactions as fraudulent or not fraudulent)

5. Customer Segmentation for Marketing → Unsupervised Learning (Clustering customers based on behavior)

6. Chess-Playing AI → Reinforcement Learning (Learning best moves through trial and error)

7. Face Recognition in Smartphones → Supervised Learning (Recognizing known faces based on labeled data)

8. Grouping News Articles by Topic → Unsupervised Learning (Clustering similar articles without labeled categories)

9. Teaching a Robot to Walk → Reinforcement Learning (Learning movement through rewards and penalties)

10. Diagnosing Diseases from X-Rays → Supervised Learning (Classifying X-ray images into disease categories based on labeled data)
